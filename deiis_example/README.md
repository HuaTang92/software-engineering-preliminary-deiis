This is a DEIIS example (Lecture 2)
===================================================

Instructions.

1) Install Java SDK and Maven.
2) Install UIMA Eclipse plugin. Instructions can be found [on this page](http://uima.apache.org/downloads/releaseDocs/2.2.0-incubating/docs/html/overview_and_setup/overview_and_setup.html#ugr.ovv.eclipse_setup.install_uima_eclipse_plugins). **Super important** don't read the UIMA tutorial any further and don't setup the UIMA_HOME variable! You don't need it, because UIMA components should be downloaded automatically by Maven. 
3) Git clone the current repository (to some location on your file system). From the command line you can do:
```
git clone git@github.com:amaiberg/software-engineering-preliminary.git
```

4) Import deiis_example project to Eclipse. To this end, go to File -> Import -> Existing projects into workspace. At this point, Eclipse will ask to you select the location of the project. Go to the place where checked out the project **git@github.com:amaiberg/software-engineering-preliminary.git** and select the subcatalog **deiis_example**.

5) In the folder **launch_configurations**, there are several launch configurations. You may need only three:

i. DEIIS UIMA Run CPE : to run an analysis engine     
ii. DEIIS UIMA CPE GUI : to run an analysis engine and optionally **edit the analysis engine descriptor**  
iii. DEIIS UIMA Annotation viewer: to see the annotated XMI files. XMI files contain CASes generated by the pipeline.

There are three collection proecessing engines (CPE) available: GoldCPE, NgramOverlapCPE, and TokenOverlapCPE.

The pipelines read questions from the folder **qaData**. The output is saved to  **outputData**

Note that for the annotation viewer you need to specify an input folder and a type system file. One folder contains xmi file. It is **qaData/xmi**. The type system file is **src/main/resources/type_system/src/main/resources/type_system/Chapter01_types.xml**
