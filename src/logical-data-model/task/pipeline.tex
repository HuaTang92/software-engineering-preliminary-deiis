\section{The Processing Pipeline}


The information processing pipeline will consist of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bfseries Test Element Annotation}: The system will read in the input file as a UIMA CAS
and annotate the question and answer spans. Each answer annotation will also
record whether or not the answer is correct. 
\item {\bfseries Token Annotation}: The system will annotate each token span in each question
and answer (break on whitespace and punctuation). 
\item {\bfseries NGram Annotation}: The system will annotate 1-, 2- and 3-grams of consecutive
tokens. 
\item {\bfseries Answer Scoring}: The system will incorporate a component that will assign an
answer score annotation to each answer. The answer score annotation will record
the score assigned to the answer. 
\item {\bfseries Evaluation}: The system will sort the answers according to their scores, and
calculate precision at N (where N is the total number of correct answers).
\end{enumerate}
