\subsection{GENETAG Annotation Guidelines}

The following are some rules about which words are considered as part of a single gene/protein mention.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Mutants

\emph{p53 mutant}

\item Parens at start or end when embedded in the name

\emph{(IGG) receptor}

\item Motifs, elements, and domains \textbf{with a gene name}

\emph{POU domain\\
src domains\\
RXR-responsive element\\
Ras-responsive enhancer}

but not

serum response element\\
AC element\\
B-cell-specific enhancer element\\
dioxin responsive transcriptional enhancer

\item Plurals and families

\emph{immunoglobulins}

\item Fusion proteins

\emph{p53 mdm2 fusion}

\item The words light/heavy chain, monomer, codon, region, exon, orf, cdna, reporter gene,
antibody, complex, gene product, mrna, oligomer, chemokine, subunit, peptide, message,
transactivator, homolog, binding site, enhancer, element, allele, isoform, intron,
promoter, operon, etc. \textbf{with a gene name}.

\item Particular qualifiers such as alpha, beta, I, II, etc. \textbf{with a gene name}

For example, \emph{topo} is not an allowable alternative to \emph{topo II}

\item If the context suggests that a word is necessary, require that word in the allowable
alternatives, even if it is still a name without the word.

\emph{rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) (\textbf{not} \emph{immunoglobulin}}\\
designated \emph{HUG1}, for \emph{Hox11 Upstream Gene} (\textbf{not} \emph{Hox11})

\item Viral promoters, LTRs and enhancers \textbf{with specific virus name}

\emph{HIV long terminal repeat\\
Simian virus 40 promoter\\
HPV 18 enhancer}

\item Antigen receptor region gene segment genes

\emph{CH genes\\
Tamarin variable region genes}

\item Peptide hormones

\emph{Vasopressin, prolactin, FSH}

\item Embedded names â€“ tag \textbf{only the gene/protein part of the name}

\emph{p53-mediated}

\end{enumerate}

The following generally \textbf{do not} qualify as gene name mentions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Generic terms

\emph{zinc finger} alone (but \emph{zinc finger protein} is an accepted gene/protein mention)

\item Mutations

p53 mutations

\item Parens at start and end which `wraps' the whole gene name

(\emph{IGG})

\item TATA boxes

\item Receptors: if a receptor is specified, the gene name without ``receptor'' is not
considered to be a valid alternative.

\item Synonyms: if a synonym is given in the sentence which implies certain words are
necessary to the gene name, they will be required in the alternatives

For \emph{rabies immunoglobin (RIG)}, ``immunoglobin'' alone will not
be a valid alternative because RIG implies that ``rabies'' is part of the name in this
context.

\item Non-peptide hormones

\item DNA and protein sequences

\end{enumerate}
