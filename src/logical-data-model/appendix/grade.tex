\subsection{Grading Guidelines}

\subsubsection{Designing and Implementing Logical Data Model (60 pts)}

\begin{itemize}

\item We will evaluate if the type system for the necessary IIS steps and its overall structure
are designed and implemented in a proper way, by looking at your
codes (Java classes and descriptors) and report. 
Specifically, each of following items has 5 pts for design and 5 pts for implementation: 
Overall Structure, Test Element Annotation, Token Annotation, NGram Annotation, Answer Scoring, and Evaluation.

\item If the basic requirement (i.e., it works!) for each of the items is met,
then the student can get 3 points, otherwise 0 to 2 points will be given.

\item If the design of each component is considered more carefully (according to
the suggestions given in the homework instruction or outside), then 4 or 5 pts
points will be given. For example, the type system is implemented in an inherited way.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Documentations, comments, coding style (30 pts)}

\begin{itemize}

\item We will first look into your report to see if it is complete, if you have
given explanations (examples) and solutions to all our concerns (20 pts), and then we will
take a look at the Javadoc package the Maven automatically generated for your
project to see if it covers all the necessary information that potential users
of your package need to know (10 pts).

\item Basic points is 6 pts (12 pts for the report), if some
important part is missing, the 0 to 5 points (0 to 11 pts for the report) might be given.

\item A detailed document can be given 7 to 10 points (13 to 20 pts for the report), for example,

\begin{enumerate}
\item good insights to the problem or architecture design covered in the report,
\item include UML design or other forms of software design in the report or Javadoc,
\item apply design pattern in an appropriate way,
\item detailed comparison of more than one methods in the report,
\item interesting discovery,
\item etc.
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Submission, folder structure, and name convention (10 pts)}

\begin{itemize}

\item We will first check the correctness of your submission (5 pts), 
and we will look into your report, code and descriptor to see whether they follow 
the normal Java name convention \footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html}} (5 pts).

\item Specifically, we expect your homework is located at the right repository 
and your project folders/files are organized as required (5 pts). 
0 to 4 points might be given if you submitted to wrong path and/or badly organized folder/files. 

\item The names of your types and files should follow the normal Java name convention (5 pts). 
Otherwise, 0 to 4 points will be given for bad naming. 


\end{itemize}
