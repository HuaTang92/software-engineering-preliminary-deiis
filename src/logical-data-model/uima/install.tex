\section{Installing UIMA SDK}

Similar to the installation processes you have gone through for Git and Maven,
you will install the UIMA binaries and a UIMA Eclipse plug-in. Different from
the installation instruction you have learned from class or the official
tutorial, you \textbf{DO NOT} need to download the UIMA SDK, uncompress and copy
the jars into the Eclipse installation path. In fact, the Maven archetype
\verb|hw1-archetype| that we built for this task makes UIMA SDK ready out of the
box for you, and the Eclipse plug-in for UIMA can be installed with the Eclipse
\textbf{Install New Software} function, which is the same as described in the
official tutorial.

\begin{enumerate}

\item As mentioned in the class and the official UIMA tutorial, you should
install Eclipse EMF plug-in, but if you strictly followed the instruction from
last homework, then EMF should have been installed as it is a default component
of Eclipse Kepler for Java Developers. Otherwise, you should install it by
yourself.

\item Follow the instruction in subsection
3.1.2\footnote{\url{https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.4.0/overview_and_setup.html\#ugr.ovv.eclipse_setup.install_uima_eclipse_plugins}}
of the \emph{Overview \& Setup} section of \emph{UIMA Manuals and Guides} by
adding the UIMA Eclipse Plug-in Update site
(\url{http://www.apache.org/dist/uima/eclipse-update-site})

\item After installation, you are able to create or edit UIMA descriptors with a
nice GUI.
 
\end{enumerate}
