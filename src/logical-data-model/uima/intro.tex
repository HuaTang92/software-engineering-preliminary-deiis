\chapter{Implementing Logical Data Model with UIMA SDK}

In this task, you need to create a type system based on UIMA SDK and use the
\texttt{JCasGen} plugin to compile your type system into Java type classes.
We assume you have finished all the reading assignments up to now, including the
UIMA specification, and browsed the Apache UIMA project website. You will find
\emph{Apache UIMA Manuals and Guides}
(\url{http://uima.apache.org/documentation.html#manuals_and_guides}) will be
helpful for you to finish this task. The \emph{Tutorials and Users' Guides}
gives you a step-by-step reference to create a type system.

\begin{enumerate}

\item After you install the UIMA Eclipse plug-in, you will need to create a
UIMA project with a type system from an archetype.

\item You might want to follow the illustrative instructions from
\emph{Tutorials and Users' Guides} to compose the type system descriptor and
Java classes.
