\section{Writing up your report}

Once you test that everything works smoothly as expected, you need to summarize
how your design and implement the type system for the task in your report.

There is no template for the homework reports, but we expect you to mention the system
design from several architectural aspects (UML, type system, engineering, design
pattern, etc.) and several algorithmic aspects (knowledge sources, NLP tools,
machine learning methods, etc.).

Finally, don't forget to put your name and Andrew ID at the top of the document,
name the file as ``hw1-ID-report.pdf'' and put it under
\texttt{src/main/resources/docs}.
