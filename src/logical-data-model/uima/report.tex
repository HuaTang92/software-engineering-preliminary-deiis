\section{Writing up your report}

Once you test that everything works smoothly as expected, you need to summarize
how your design and implement the components for the gene mention tagging task
in your report.

There is no template for the report, but we expect you to mention the system
design from several architectural aspects (UML, type system, engineering, design
pattern, etc.) and several algorithmic aspects (knowledge sources, NLP tools,
machine learning methods, etc.), and also the preliminary experiments you
conducted to evaluate the overall performance of your system (or many each of
your components if you implemented multiple solutions).

If you are still not clear how to write the report. You can also consider to
answer the following questions from the official Gene Mention task submission
guideline:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Please identify/describe any machine learning techniques used:.......... 
\item Please identify/describe any NLP techniques/components used:........ 
\item Please identify/describe any external (marked up text) training data used:......... 
\item Please identify/describe any external lexical resources (terminology lists)used:........ 
\item Please describe any rule sets used:......... 
\item If your system interacts with or uses data from any biological database(s), please describe:.......... 
\item Please identify/describe any other relevant resources used to train/develop your system:......... 
\item Please describe the general data flow in your system:.......... 
\item Other information of interest:.........
\end{enumerate}

Finally, don't forget to put your name and Andrew ID at the top of the document,
name the file as ``hw1-ID-report.pdf'' and put it under
\texttt{src/main/resources/docs}.
