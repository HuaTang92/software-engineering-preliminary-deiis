\section{Maven}

If you have Maven installed, you can skip this task.

Similar to the Git installation, you will not need a standalone (as opposed to
the m2e plug-in) Maven most of time, since m2e has an embedded Maven runtime by
default. But we (and some other developpers) found that in some environments,
m2e could not find the correct installation path of the embedded runtime to
execute certain goals (e.g., deploy, release:prepare, release:perform). If you
find a feasible solution to get rid of this, please let us know.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Download Maven 3.1.0 (Binary, either tar.gz or zip) from
\url{http://maven.apache.org/download.html}.

\item Follow the installation instructions (for difference platforms) at the
bottom of the page to install Maven. The first note from the instruction is:

\begin{quote}
\emph{Maven is a Java tool, so you must have Java installed in order to
proceed. More precisely, you need a Java Development Kit (JDK), the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) is not sufficient.}
