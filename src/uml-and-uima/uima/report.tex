\section{Final report}
There is no template for the report, but we expect you to discuss 
\textbf{both}
the architectural (UML, type system, engineering, design
pattern, etc.) and algorithmic aspects (knowledge sources, NLP tools,
machine learning methods, etc.) of your system. 
In addition,
you need to describe the preliminary experiments you
conducted to evaluate the overall performance of your system.
If you implemented several solutions (or several variants of
 tagging components), 
it will be great to evaluate their performance as well.

When writing the report,
please try to answer the following questions (from the official Gene Mention task submission
guideline):

\begin{enumerate}
\item Please identify/describe any machine learning techniques used:.......... 
\item Please identify/describe any NLP techniques/components used:........ 
\item Please identify/describe any external (marked up text) training data used:......... 
\item Please identify/describe any external lexical resources (terminology lists)used:........ 
\item Please describe any rule sets used:......... 
\item If your system interacts with or uses data from any biological database(s), please describe:.......... 
\item Please identify/describe any other relevant resources used to train/develop your system:......... 
\item Please describe the general data flow in your system:.......... 
\item Other information of interest:.........
\end{enumerate}

Finally, \textbf{don't forget to put your name and Andrew ID at the top of the document},
name the file as ``hw1-ID-report.pdf'' and put it under
\texttt{src/main/resources/docs}.
