\chapter{Installing and Configuring Softwares}

In this task, you are required to install the tools you've already been familiar
with (at least heard about).

\textbf{Important notes:} This might be the hardest part of your Homework 0,
since installation of the same software on different platforms differs a lot,
which means we could not show you detailed steps for each platform. Instead, we
will provide you with links for the installation instructions for you to follow,
and we have created three forums for you to discuss Windows/Linux/Mac platform
related issues. We will try our best to help you solve whatever problems you
might have, but we also encourage you, the experts in any of these platforms, to
work with us to answer the questions from your classmates. You can find the
discussion boards at \url{http://blackboard.andrew.cmu.edu}, and select the
course, then the \textbf{Tools} and \textbf{Discussion Board}.

\input{config/java}

\input{config/git}

\input{config/maven}

\input{config/eclipse}

That's the start of your developement. From now on, everthing will become less
platform specific, and we will show you how to configure the workspace, create
your Maven project and release it in the rest of the homework.
