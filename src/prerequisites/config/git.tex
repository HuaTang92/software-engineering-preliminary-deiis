\section{Installing Git}

If you have Git installed, you can skip this task.

You will not need Git (specifically, execute Git goals from command line) in
most cases, because we will have EGit (the Git plug-in for Eclipse) installed.
But sadly, there is a case you have to install the Git, when the Maven plug-in
for Eclipse (aka m2e) does need Git (not EGit) and the SCM URI you specified to
execute Git commands. (Don't know what SCM is? Probably you need to go back to
the previous task.)

\begin{enumerate}

\item Visit \url{http://git-scm.com/downloads} to download Git 1.8.4.

\item You can refer to the Pro Git book for how to install Git for different
platforms (at \url{http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git}),
and how to set up Git (at
\\\url{http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup}).
