\section{Performing a Maven Release}

In the last task, you will need to submit your Java code by performing a release
of your code. But remember that Maven release plug-in will check if all the
changes you have made have been checked into the remote repository (i.e. GitHub
in our case). So, let's perform a git-commit and a git-push.

\begin{enumerate}

\end{minipage}
\hspace{-1em}
\end{figure}

\item Similar to what you did earlier, you execute git-commit and git-push to
the project, and you could see the ``greater than'' symbol disappears and a
``master'' label is attached to project path, which means you are successful
with your git-commit and git-push.

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}

\end{minipage}
\hspace{-2em}
\end{figure}

\item Sometimes, the embedded Maven runtime from m2e cannot be succesfully
executed to perform a release goal. Therefore, we should add the externally
installed Maven runtime into the Eclipse. Click \textbf{Window} (or
\textbf{Edit}) $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Preferences} (see Figure
\ref{submit-03-add-maven-done}).

\item Select \textbf{Maven} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Installations}. You will see
the ``Embedded'' runtime (as shown in Figure \ref{submit-02-add-maven}). Click
\textbf{Add\ldots} to locate the installation path of your Maven runtime.

\item Then, you could see an ``External'' runtime in the installation lists. See
Figure \ref{submit-03-add-maven-done}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{submit-04-run-config}
\caption{Getting ready for a release\label{submit-04-run-config}}
\end{figure}

\item Now you can execute a Maven goal within Eclipse (of course, you can also
do that outside Eclipse from command line). Click the down-arrow next to the
\textbf{Run} button, and select \textbf{Run Configurations\ldots}. See Figure
\ref{submit-04-run-config}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{submit-05-run-config-done}
\caption{Configuring Maven goal\label{submit-05-run-config-done}}
\end{figure}

\item In the ``Run Configurations'' window, double-click \textbf{Maven Build} to
create a new Maven goal. See Figure \ref{submit-05-run-config-done}. Rename your
run configuration name as ``release'' (optional), and click \textbf{Browse
Workspace\ldots} to select your project, and type in your goals as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
release:prepare release:perform
\end{verbatim}

This actually defines two goals ``release:prepare'' and ``release:perform''. As
you will probably encounter tons of errors during this step, we should review
some details of the Maven release.

The Maven
guide\footnote{\url{https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-releasing.html}}
tells us what is happening behind these two goals:

\begin{quote}
The release:prepare goal will:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that there are no uncommitted changes in the workspace.
\item Prompt the user for the desired tag, release and development version
names.
\item Modify and commit release information into the pom.xml file.
\item Tag the entire project source tree with the new tag name.
\end{enumerate}

The release:perform goal will:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Extract file revisions versioned under the new tag name.
\item Execute the maven build lifecycle on the extracted instance of the
project.
\item Deploy the versioned artifacts to appropriate local and remote
repositories.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

If the goals are not executed sucessfully, a relatively useful message will be
printed out to console to help you discover where the problem is.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{submit-06-release}
\caption{A successful release!\label{submit-06-release}}
\end{figure}

\item Finally after you fixed all the problems (if any), you could see the very
pleasant ``BUILD SUCCESS'' message in the console (as shown in Figure
\ref{submit-06-release}), which means you've done with your Homework 0!
Congratulations!

\begin{qa}

\item[Q1] The ``release:prepare'' goal could be executed successfully, but there
was an error during ``release:perform''. How can I start all over
again?\footnote{Reported by Kartik Mandaville.}

\item[A1] A successful ``prepare'' with an unsuccessful ``perform'' always leads
to a very subtle situation. Sometimes, you can try to execute a
``release:rollback'' Maven goal to revert to the previous status, or you are try
to manually delete the \verb|release.properties| file under your project
diretory, and make sure you are now working on a SNAPSHOT version. (You can
check your version from Maven POM Editor, and you have an opened Maven POM
Editor, be sure to close it and open it again since it will not be automatically
refreshed after you execute a Maven goal.) If it is no longer a SNAPSHOT
version, you should modify the \textbf{Version} field to something like
``0.0.2-SNAPSHOT'' (without quotes). You might want to refer to
\url{http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-releasing.html} about the details
of the release process.

\item[Q2] The process hangs forever during Maven ``release:prepare'' executing a
``git push'' command, in other words, it doesn't terminate or produce any
further useful information. What should I do?

\item[A2] We are sure there is some bug with the plugin related to this issue.
But there still some workarounds to consider.

\begin{enumerate}
\item If you generate a public key with a passphrase (i.e., you typed in
something before you pressed \textbf{Enter}), then try to regenerate another
public key following the same instruction and paste it to GitHub.
\item Try to log back into GitHub to see if your email address has been
verified.
\item Turn to command line to execute Maven goal by typing
\verb|mvn release:prepare release:perform| from the project directory to see
if it terminates automatically or still hangs there forever.
\item Try to find the last command in the log message shown in the console
(e.g., \verb|git push ... master:master|), and directly type in the same command
in the command line to see if additional verification (e.g., adding a host to
\verb|known_host| list) is required.
\end{enumerate}

\item[Q3] What if I find some bugs after it has been released? How can I
resubmit my code?

\item[A3] You can look at the ``Overview'' tab in the Maven POM Editor for your
pom.xml file. The version should be ``0.0.2-SNAPSHOT'', which indicates a
previous version has been generated. Now, you could redo this task (git-commit,
git-push, run Maven goals) to release the version 0.0.2. We will evaluate your
code based on the latest release.

\item[Q4] How could I check if my submission is successful?

\item[A4] First of all, don't worry about it, even if by the deadline, we
haven't received your submission, we will notify you, and help you check what
the problem may be before you start Homework 1.

If you want to check your submission, you can go to
\url{http://mu.lti.cs.cmu.edu:8081/nexus/index.html} back again, and log in with
your password, go to \textbf{View/Repositories} $\rightarrow$
\textbf{Repositories} on the left, then click \textbf{Course Releases} on the
right, unfold directories along the groupId path, and if you see your artifact
at the end, then you've done!
