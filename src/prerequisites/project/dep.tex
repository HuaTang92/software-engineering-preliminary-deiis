\section{Adding a dependency from Maven repository}
\label{AddedDepFromMaven}

Maven repository stores all the artifacts that repository users have deployed,
and we can take the advantage of Maven repository to add project dependencies on
your other projects or other developers' projects. In this task, you are going
to add a dependency of Stanford CoreNLP, which is hosted on the Central
Repository. In the next homework, you will find several useful dependencies in
our project repository.

\begin{enumerate}
 
\begin{figure}[t]

\end{figure}

\item Do you remember how the configuration of your Maven project is stored?
Yes, the pom.xml file! Open it by double clicking the file name, and you will
see the pom.xml is opened with ``Maven POM Editor'' as in Figure
\ref{repo-01-pom}. If you find it is opened with a XML Editor or Text Editor,
you should right click on the file name, you choose \textbf{Open With}
$\rightarrow$ \textbf{Maven POM Editor}.

\item Before you add a dependency to your Maven project, you might want to look
at all the tabs by clicking the tab name at the bottom of the Maven POM Editor.
In the ``Overview'' tab, you need to type in some SCM information. Maven will
use this information to connect to your remote GitHub repository. In general,
the format of the scm is:

\begin{verbatim}
scm:<SCM_PROVIDER><DELIMITER><PROVIDER_SPECIFIC_PART>
\end{verbatim}

For our purposes, it is best to use the following format:

\begin{verbatim}
scm:git:git@github.com:GITHUB_ID/REPOSITORY_ID.git
\end{verbatim}

For this assignment specifically, you will need:
\begin{verbatim}
scm:git:git@github.com:GITHUB_ID/hw0-ANDREW_ID.git
\end{verbatim}

Note that here we use \emph{SSH} and not \emph{HTTPS} authorization!
To make it working, you need to create an SSH key as mention in Section \ref{SectionSSHGit}.
Please, refer to the documentation on the \href{http://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys}{Git site}.

You need to type in the SCM URL corresponding to your remote repository in
\textbf{Connection} and \textbf{Developer} under \textbf{SCM} field. Details of
SCM URL can be found at \url{http://maven.apache.org/scm/scm-url-format.html}.

\lstinputlisting[language=XML,float,linewidth=1.1\textwidth,caption=Configuring pom.xml,label=pom]{pom.xml}

\item Next, you should inform Maven what the URL of our course Maven repository
is, which can be done by editing the POM file directly. Click the last tab
``pom.xml'', you are able to edit directly from the Maven POM Editor. Compare
your POM content with Listing \ref{pom}, and add the missing lines to your POM.

As you've already specified the Group Id, Artifact Id, SCM information in early
steps through the setup wizard or ``Overview'' tab of Maven POM Editor, you will
find these concents (similar to Line 1 to 11 in Listing \ref{pom}) are already
there to in you POM. You need to copy the content from Line 12 to Line 48 from
Listing \ref{pom} into your POM. We will briefly describe what the meaning of
each POM block is.

\begin{itemize}

\item[repositories] (Line 12 to 15) define a subset of your repositories
(declared in your \verb|settings.xml| file) related to the current Maven
project. You could retrieve all the existing artifacts from these repositories
to make your current project depend on. Note that once you add a new
\textbf{repository} item in the \textbf{repositories} group, you are enabled to
view the artifacts in the ``Maven Repositories'' view (in next task).

\item[distributionManagement] (Line 16 to 25) will be used only if you plan to
make a release for your artifact. For example, in Listing \ref{pom},
repositories for releases and snapshots are separately defined.

\item[plugins] (Line 26 to 46) include specific plug-ins required by the project
to perform Maven goals. For example, you should specify the location of your
pom.xml file when you perform the \verb|release:perform| goal.

\end{itemize}

\begin{qa}

\item[Q1] Is m2e so stupid? Part of the POM can be editted with perfect GUI or
wizard, but why do we need to manually type in additional XML texts?

\item[A1] We are also able to add dependencies (in the next few steps) and add
plugins into the pom.xml content with m2e GUI, but you have to add fields, such
as \textbf{repositories}, \textbf{distributionManagement}, and so on, manually
and directly to pom.xml, because the m2e plugin does not support add such fields
in a more effect way from Maven POM Editor. Guess what it means? It means m2e
does not recommend us to manually add these contents to pom.xml, although they
are crucial to a Maven project.

Can you find the difference between the contents those can be added with GUI and
those cannot? Contents added by GUI are usually project specific, while manually
added contents are usually global contents shared across different projects in
your workspace and organization, which means a ``meta'' pom should be generated
for all the individual ``child'' Maven project. That's how Maven and archetype
were originally introduced. We will learn to create a Maven project from an
archetype in your next homework.

\end{qa}

\item Finally, try to press \textbf{Ctrl+Shift+F} within the pom.xml editor
scope!

\end{minipage}
\hspace{-1em}
\end{figure}

\item Now click \textbf{Window} $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Show View} $\rightarrow$
\textbf{Other\ldots} to select a new view. See Figure
\ref{repo-04-project-repo}.

\item In the ``Show View'' window, select \textbf{Maven} $\rightarrow$
\textbf{Maven Repositories} to open the ``Maven Repositories'' view. See Figure
\ref{repo-05-dependency}.

\begin{figure}[t]

\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{repo-04-project-repo}
\caption{Viewing additional project repository from Maven Repository view\label{repo-04-project-repo}}
\end{figure}

\item You can see the ``Maven Repositories'' view at the bottom of your
workspace, you are able to unfold ``Project Repositories'' since you have added
items in the \textbf{repositories} field of your \verb|pom.xml| file.

\begin{qa}

\item[Q1] I could not unfold the \textbf{Project Repositories} or there is no
artifact inside it.

\item[A1] You should try the following three solutions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item As you did before, go back to \textbf{Edit} (or \textbf{Window})
$\rightarrow$ \textbf{Preferences}, and choose \textbf{Maven} $\rightarrow$
\textbf{User Settings} again, you will see the plug-in could find the setting
file you specified (see Figure \ref{eclipse-04-maven-setting-back}), and click
\textbf{Update Settings}.
\item Click the ``double arrows'' icon (second icon in the top-right corner of
``Maven Repositories'' view) to reload settings.xml.
\item Right-click on each individual repository in ``Maven Repositories'' view
(e.g. \textbf{deployment} in our example), select \textbf{Minimum Index Enabled}
or \textbf{Enable Full Index} instead of \textbf{Disable Index Details}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{qa}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{repo-05-dependency}
\caption{Adding a Jar dependency\label{repo-05-dependency}}
\end{figure}

\item Now you could add an artifact dependency for your first Maven Project. Go
to the \textbf{Dependencies} tab in Maven POM Editor. See Figure
\ref{repo-05-dependency}. Click \textbf{Add\ldots} in the ``Dependencies'' area.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{repo-06-corenlp}
\caption{Searching for CoreNLP\label{repo-06-corenlp}}
\end{figure}

\item In the popup window, directly type in ``stanford-corenlp'' in the search
box under the message \textbf{Enter groupId, artifactId or sha1 prefix or
pattern (*)}, and select \textbf{edu.stanford.nlp stanford-corenlp}. Now you
will find the three fields at the top: \textbf{Group Id}, \textbf{Artifact Id},
and \textbf{Version} will be automatically filled with the correct information.
Click \textbf{OK} to continue.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{repo-07-maven-dep}
\caption{Stanford CoreNLP appearing in Maven Dependencies\label{repo-07-maven-dep}}
\end{figure}

\item Finally, we could see the newly added dependency ``stanford-corenlp:
1.3.3'' is shown in the left column of ``Dependencies'' field. In addition, you
will find the new dependency is also added to the Maven Repositories in the
``Project Explorer'' view. See Figure \ref{repo-07-maven-dep}.

\end{enumerate}

Now you have added the dependency on Stanford CoreNLP, and you will base on the
denpendency to write in your own code in the next task.
