\chapter{Execution Architecture with CPE}


In this task, you will need to learn what CPE is and how to use it.
You are required to run your pipeline with Collection Processing Engine (CPE) instead of UIMA Document Analyzer. 

\section{Learning CPE}

There are several useful resources to help you get started with CPE:
\begin{itemize}
  \item You can learn basic concepts and usage about CPE from 
				\emph{Chapter 2. Collection Processing Engine Developer's Guide} 
				(\url{http://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.4.0/tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.cpe}). 
	   \item Also, you can view the manual for CPE GUI 
	   (\url{http://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-2.4.0/tools.html#ugr.tools.cpe}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Creating and Running your CPE}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Ideally, depending on where the input file is located (on a local file
system, in a jar file, or from an external sources, e.g. network), your
collection reader needs to be general enough to establish a connection to the
file source and open a stream to read the content. But for our task, you only
need to consider a folder of files located on the file system, which means 
you can use org.apache.uima.tools.components.FileSystemCollectionReader directly, 
and only need to write a Collection Reader descriptor to fit your needs.  

\item You are required to create a Cas Consumer based on the Evaluator component of homework 2, 
and include it in your CPE pipeline.

\item Please name your CPE descriptor as hw3-ID-CPE.xml and put it
under \texttt{src/main/resources/}, so that we could easily find the entry point
of your pipeline.
