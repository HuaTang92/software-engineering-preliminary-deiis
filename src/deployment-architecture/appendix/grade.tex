\subsection{Grading Guidelines}

\subsubsection{Execution of system with CPE (40 pts)}

\begin{itemize}

\item We will evaluate your system for the necessary IIS steps and its overall structure whether designed and implemented in a proper way, by looking at your
codes (Java classes and analysis descriptors) and report. 
Specifically, each of following items carry 50\% design and 50\% implementation points: 
We shall check your CPE descriptor, CollectionReader, Annotators and CasConsumer.
\item If the basic requirement (i.e., it works!) for each of the items is met,
then the student can get upto 11-20 points, otherwise 0-10 points will be given.

\item If the design and implementation of CollectionReader, Annotators and CasConsumer is considered more carefully (according to the suggestions given in the homework instruction or outside), then upto 21-40 pts points will be given. For example, the CollectionReader can read from any given input source.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Deployment architecuture with UIMA-AS (40 pts)}

\begin{itemize}

\item We will evaluate your system based on if UIMA-AS client and service classes are designed and implemented in a proper way, by looking at your codes (Java classes and analysis descriptors) and report. 
Specifically, each of following items carry 50\% design and 50\% implementation points: 
\item If the basic requirement (i.e., it works!) for each of the items is met,
then the student can get upto 20-30 points, otherwise 0-20 points will be given.

\item If required deployment descriptors are designed and configured properly, you will get upto 31-40 points. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Documentations, comments, coding style (20 pts)}

\begin{itemize}

\item We will first look into your report to see if it is complete, if you have
given explanations (examples) and solutions to all our concerns, and then we will take a look at the Javadoc package for your project to see if it covers all the necessary information that potential users of your package need to know.

\item Basic points are upto 10-15 for report, if some
important part(s) is missing, the 0-10 points might be given.

\item A detailed documentation can be given upto 20 pts, for example,

\begin{enumerate}
\item good insights to the problem or architecture design covered in the report,
\item apply design pattern in an appropriate way,
\item explanation on why UIMA-AS for this case is better option
\item interesting discovery,
\item proper use of naming convetions in code etc.
\end{enumerate}


\end{itemize}
