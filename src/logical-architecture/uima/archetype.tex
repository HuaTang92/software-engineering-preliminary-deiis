\section{Creating Maven project from the archetype}

For this task, we have prepared another archetype to help you quickly build your
project. The tutorial for Homework 1 might help you create a Maven project from
an archetype.

For Homework 2, you need to add the following Catalog URL

\begin{center}
\textbf{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amaiberg/DEIIS-hw2-archetype/master/archetype-catalog.xml}
\end{center}

The archetype for Homework is

\begin{center}
\textbf{hw2-archetype}
\end{center}

Also remember that the \textbf{Group Id} and \textbf{Artifact Id} for Homework 2
are

\begin{center}
\textbf{edu.cmu.lti.11791.f14.hw2}
\end{center}

and

\begin{center}
\textbf{hw2-ID}
\end{center}

with ID being your Andrew Id.

Similarly, you need to edit the \texttt{pom.xml} file to provide the SCM
information related to your GitHub repository (it should be different
from the previous homework). 

Unlike Homework 1, we provide a standard type system that you should use.
This type system is represented by an XML file (\texttt{deiis\_types.xml}).
In addition, we provide Java classes generated from this
file (using \texttt{JCasGen}).
