\section{Creating Maven project from the archetype}

For this task, we have prepared another archetype to help you quickly build your
project. The tutorial for Homework 1 might help you create a Maven project from
an archetype.

For Homework 2, you need to add the following Catalog URL

\begin{center}
\textbf{http://oaqa.github.io/DEIIS-hw2-archetype/repository/archetype-catalog.xml}
\end{center}

The archetype for Homework is

\begin{center}
\textbf{hw2-archetype}
\end{center}

Also remember that the \textbf{Group Id} and \textbf{Artifact Id} for Homework 2
are

\begin{center}
\textbf{edu.cmu.lti.11791.f13.hw2}
\end{center}

and

\begin{center}
\textbf{hw2-ID}
\end{center}

with ID being your Andrew Id.

Similarly, you need to edit the \texttt{pom.xml} file to type in the SCM
information of your GitHub repository. You can see that different from Homework
1, we have also included the type system file with Java classes generated from
\texttt{JCasGen} that your annotators might need. Your implementation starts
here.
