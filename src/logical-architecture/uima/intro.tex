In this task, you need to 
create several analysis engines (as well as
respective implementations of annotators) 
and combine them in a single aggregate analysis engine.
You may find \href{http://uima.apache.org/documentation.html#manuals_and_guides}{Apache UIMA Manuals and
Guides}
helpful as they provide step-by-step guidelines for analysis engines creation.
