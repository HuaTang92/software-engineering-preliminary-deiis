\chapter{Implementing A Simple Information Processing Task with UIMA SDK}

In this task, you need to 
create several analysis engines (as well as
respective implementations of annotators) 
and combine them in a single Aggregate Analysis Engine (AAE)
(in turn, you bundle up your AAE with a collection reader and 
a CAS consumer to obtain a full-fledged CPE).
You may find \href{http://uima.apache.org/documentation.html#manuals_and_guides}{Apache UIMA Manuals and
Guides}
helpful as they provide step-by-step guidelines to create AEs and CPEs.
